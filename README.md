# Linux-Shell-Design
It is a linux shell, every folder contains different implementation of a different functionality. 

Execute Commands: This shell is able to execute almost every command that linux shell is able to execute.

Alias-Path Directory: Defining aliases and using them afterwards to change directories faster than before.

Morning Alarm: Really fun command, you can set an alarm to any time with any music just typing two arguments.

Alias-Path Automated: In zsh, there is a package called "z" that automates short path aliases. In this project I have tried to implement such feature.
